# Data Type

## Number

> There are two main type of number

- Integer
- Floating Point

### Integer Data Type

| Data Type | Minimum | Maximum |
|-----------|---------|---------|
|int8|-128|127|
|int16 | -32768| 32767|
|int32| -2147483648|2147483647|
|int64|-9223372036854775808|9223372036854775807|
|uint8|0|255|
|uint16 |0| 65535|
|uint32|0|4294967295|
|uint64|0|18446744073709551615|

### Floating Point Data Type

| Data Type | Minimum | Maximum |
|-----------|---------|---------|
|float32|1.18x10<sup>-38</sup>|3.4x10<sup>38</sup>|
|float64 |2.23x10<sup>-308</sup>|1.80x10<sup>308</sup>|
|complex64|complex number with float32 real and imaginary parts. |
|complex128|complex number with float64 real and imaginary parts.|

### Alias for Number Type

| Data Type | Alias For|
|-----------|---------|
|byte| uint8|
|rune|int32|
|int|int32 minimum|
|uint| uint32 minimum|

## Boolean

Boolean is a data type that has two values which is `true` or `false`. In go lang, boolean data type is represented using `bool` keyword.

## String

String is a collection of characters. The number of characters inside a string is start from zero to infinity. String data type in Go-Lang is represented by `string` keyword. Value of String inside Go-Lang always be start with `"` and end with `"`.

### Function for String

| Function | Description |
|---|---|
| len("string") | Menghitung jumlah karakter di String |
| "string"[number] | Mengambil karakter pada posisi yang ditentukan |

## Variable

Variable is a place to store a value. Variable help us to reuse the same data everywhere we want. In Go-Lang, Variable can only use to save a single data type. If you want to use more than one data type, then we need to create more than one variable. To create a variable, we use `var` followed by the name of the variable and the data type.

In Go-Lang, we don't really need to use `var` to create a variable. But you need to assign a value when you initialize the variable and make sure that you are using `:=` to assign the value. Example :

```go
myText := "Hello World"
```

We can also declare multiple variable at once. Example :

```go
var(
    name = "My Name"
    age = 34
)
```

## Constant

Constant is a variable in which the value can't be change after it's assigned. Creating a constant is the same as variable, the only difference is the keyword used which is `const` not `var`.

> When creating constant, we must initialize its value.

Example :

```go
const firstName string = "Ryan"
const lastName = "Pratama"
const value = 100000
```

 We can also declare multiple constant at once. Example:

```go
const (
    firstName = "Ryan"
    lastName = "Pratama"
    value = 100000
)
```
